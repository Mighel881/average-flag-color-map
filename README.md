# average-flag-color-map

Creates a map of the US and World. Each state/country has been colored with the average color of it's flag. They have been averaged in three ways, HSV, RGB, and HSV with hue only.

I realize the structure of this project is duplicated for states and countries, but I couldn't be bothered to combine them properly
